				    <p>XWork2 is designed around the concept of GOF's Command Design Pattern.</p>

<h2><a name="XWorkArchitecture-CommandDesignPattern"></a>Command Design Pattern</h2>


<h3><a name="XWorkArchitecture-General"></a>General</h3>

<p>A Command design pattern, abstract the logic of a particular execution into an object, the command object. If an originator is to interact with a receiver using a command pattern, direct reference between them could be abstracted away. Originator would probably create a command object, that when executed will know how to get its receiver and perform the necessary logics. There could be a variety of command that being able to communicate with a variety  of receivers, most probably created through some sort of Factory pattern.</p>

<h3><a name="XWorkArchitecture-RelationwithXWork2"></a>Relation with XWork2</h3>

<p>Command in XWork2 sense would be XWork2 Action, while the originator would most possibly translate to the client that grab hold of a copy of XWork2 Action. A receiver will most likely be XWork2 Result. XWork2 enhance the concept a bit with the introduction of ActionProxy, a thin layer representing the action such that action could be loaded differently and ActionInvocation which details the actual execution of the action itself.</p>
